# Roadmap

At the present time, jwt-security middleware is in a stable state. Per Capital
One practices, the project owners will continue to monitor the repository for
security vulnerabilities. The team will also respond to issues and feature
requests raised by the community.

For an example of how to raise such a request, see [#6](https://github.com/capitalone/jwt-security/issues/6).
